              price is due on the date of your order unless the price is £2,000 or less. The remaining 50% will be due on arrival of the Goods in the UK.
              Where the price of the Goods is £2,000 or less, you must make pay ment for 100% of the price on the date of your order. Goods will not
              be delivered until pay ment is received in full. If fitting is required, please request a quotation. Our prices may change at any time, but
              price changes will normally not affect orders that We have confirmed with you. There are certain circumstances when we may increase th:
              price of the goods and/or Space Planning Services after we have confirmed y our order. If you are a consumer these are set out in Paragrap|!
              12.4 of the Full Terms, and if you are a business these are set out in Paragraph 10.5 of the Full Terms. If you do not make any pay ment
              on time, We may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% a year above the base lending rate of Natwest Bank ple
              from time to time. Our prices include VAT. However, if the rate of VAT changes, unless you have already paid in full, We will adjust the
              rate of VAT to reflect the new standard rates.
              Please note that if we provide Our Space Planning Services to you and you subsequently cancel your Order (if you are entitled to
              cancellation as per the applicable Full Terms) or decide not to place an Order for Goods, We will be entitled to charge you 20% of the
              price quoted by Us for the Goods as a compensation for services already provided by Us.
              Changes to order or terms
              You may request a change to your order at any time before We order the Goods and/or provide the Space Planning or Fitting Services by
              contacting Us. In the case of made-to-measure Goods, We will notify you in writing where there 1s a change in the total price. If We are
              unable to supply you with the Goods, Space Planning Services or Fitting Services, We will inform y ou of this in writing and We will not
              process the order. No changes can be made to the order for made-to-measure Goods once confirmed into production. Should an
              order be cancelled and production has started we will have to charge you the full price of the made-to-measure Goods. If you are
              a consumer please see our full consumer terms and conditions for more detail about your cancellation rights.

              We have adequate access to the delivery address. If We are unable to deliver the Goods due to a lack of access, you will be charged any
              extra storage and delivery fees as applicable.
